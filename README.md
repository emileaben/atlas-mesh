# input: CSV file with family relations between orgs (ask Jelena)

# this creates a family json file from a given CSV (i think this was just a dead-end. not used for anything at the moment?)
families-json.py

# this does the mesh measurements from the given CSV
mesh.py

# output msm_state.json

## analysis script that produces family-ties.json
analyse-mesh.py


## i think this is just a script used for debugging
doit.py

# output family-ties.json

(this gets attached to an observableHQ notebook for further analysis)
